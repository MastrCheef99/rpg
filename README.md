# Untitled RPG Game
This RPG was dreamt up when I started playing Final Fantasy 6. A few days earlier I was thinking about a possible game for Jojo's Bizarre Adventure and thought about how cool and wacky some of the stand battles are in later parts are due to the hyper-specificity of each stand. This concept of hyper-specificity is what I want the game to focus on. Most games will give you a ton of different options for builds in battle and many of them are viable in a ton of situations, and some games, like Fear and Hunger, expand this further giving each option many uses both in battle and out. This game is more like a puzzle in a way. You are given a pretty large set of options and must reason out what options will work in a hyper specific scenario.
